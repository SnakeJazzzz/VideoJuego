            In "Protect the Egg" you will engage in a strategic battle against hordes of monsters.
            With the help of cards you will summon your troops with the aim of defending a dragon egg.
            The mastery of deck creation, positioning of units and structures,
            plus resource management is key to victory in this competitive 2D computer game.
            For how many hordes can you protect it?
